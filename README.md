# CS-360MobileArchitectProgramming


This app was meant to allow a user to add and remove items to and from an inventory. There is a username and password screen which allows allows for the creation of an account; this is stored locally but can be easily refactored to store the Usernames and Passwords on a remote server for account verification and generation. I used an emulator through Android Studio to develop and test the App. One thing that surprised me was the availability of libraries for data manipulation, this project uses SQL Lite.
